Just my dotfiles.ã€€Not much to see here.

- I use [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) just so it works semalessly on Mac/Linux/Codespaces
- Couple customizations mostly reflect my dubious taste in colors and shortcuts ðŸ˜…
- Self-reminders:
  - clone this to `~/.dotfiles` and run `./install` to symlink everything
  - (wonder if I could automate these) on a new mac, run:
    - `chsh -s /bin/bash` to use bash as default shell
    - `ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/id_rsa` to add the ssh key passphrase to the Keychain
  - if you add a new file, edit `install.conf.yaml` to include it
